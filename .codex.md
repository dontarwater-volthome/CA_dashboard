## Working rules
- Always work on branch: deploy
- Always pull/rebase before changes:
  git checkout deploy
  git pull --rebase origin deploy

## Safety
- Never hardcode secrets/tokens (HubSpot, Google, etc.)
- Use Google Apps Script Script Properties for secrets

## Finish steps (must do every time)
- Show a brief diff summary
- Commit with a short message
- Push to origin/deploy so CI deploys to Apps Script
